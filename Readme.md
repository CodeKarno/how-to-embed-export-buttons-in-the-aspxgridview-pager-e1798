# How to embed export buttons in the ASPxGridView pager


<p>This example was imported from the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S132943">S132943</a> report to provide users with export buttons in the grid's pager.<br />
The ASPxGridView is created and bound at runtime in the Page_Init event handler.<br />
The inherited control can also be imported into a separate assembly, as it was firstly kindly presented in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/S132943">S132943</a> article.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The example is not recommended, because according to its design the exporting is performed during callbacks.<br />
It is possible to download a file without callbacks using a solution from the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2577">How to load a file on the callback of the ASPxGridView using the ASPxWebControl.RedirectOnCallback method</a> example.</p>
